Intro To Responsive Layouts Notes
---------------------------------
---------------------------------

* What Is Responsive Design
---------------------------

Viewport tag is important as it tells the browser how to handle the pages and dimensions and scaling, default with emmett

Fluid widths - Max and min widths

Media queries

Use Rem over px

Mobile first 


* Getting Started With Media Queries
------------------------------------

Media Query Syntax:        
@media (max-width: 500px) {}

Smartphone widths usually under 500px
Tablet is usually under 768px

To specifically target tablet use
@media (min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 500px) {}

only screen just refers to media type, like print etc.

To only load stylesheet for screensize, create seperate css file for mobile etc.
Then create link stylesheet in head and add media attribute to only load stylesheet for specified screen size
<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (max-width: 768px)" href="mobile.css"> can place after everything to take precedence


* Em and Rem units
------------------

Em relative to font size of parent container
Rem is relative to font-size of html element - default 16px
If em is used for padding and font size is set to element, em will calculate size using element and not parent
Em isn't consistent with nested elements

Rem uses html root font-size, set to 10px to make calculations easier or to 62.5%

* Vh & Vw Units
---------------

Use vh to fill container height
Use rem units to maintain a ratio on text and padding

* Making The Hotel Website Fully Responsive
-------------------------------------------

Add extra style sheet and media attribute to select stylesheet when specific screen size is used, eg:
<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (max-width: 768px)" href="/css/mobile.css">
To test use a body with display none to just verify our rule is working.
