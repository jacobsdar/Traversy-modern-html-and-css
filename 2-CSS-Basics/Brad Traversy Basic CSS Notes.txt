* Backgrounds & Borders
-----------------------

Border has three properties: width, color and style - does not matter in which order

Do not need a border property on an element to use border radius property to round element


* Box Model, Margin & Padding
-----------------------------

Use * selector to reset margin and padding in css for all elements
Use box-sizing property to border box, so that elements remain consistents sizing i.e padding does not add to width of element


* Float & Alignment
-------------------

Float is old technology, replaced by flexbox and grid

To center container/element, add width to element and give a margin of auto

Remember max-width for responsive design, as normal width doesn't scale

Float - left or right, container to be floated must have a width property
In exercise, floating is affected due to extra size added to container by padding
using box-sizing with border box should fix issue.
New div added below/behind floated divs also cause an issue as these floated elements weren't cleared
Adding a utility class eg. .clr {clear:both} to a div inbetween our box 3 and box 4 rectifies the issue
 


* Link State & Button Styling

* Navigation Menu Styling
-------------------------

Floating our navbar collapsed the background, unable to see the color
To fix it we will set an overflow property with the value of auto in the parent element, background pertains to content inside, although overflow is used on scrollbars

Also remember when creating a navbar, to add padding to the link elements instead of list elements as it will affect the hover property when used to change colour etc.

* Aside Visibility, Order & Negative Margin
-------------------------------------------

classes override element styling
!important overrides all styles regardless

negative margins should be avoided but are possible
negative padding doesn't work however
